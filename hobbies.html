<h1 style="font-size:65px"> Badminton </h1>
<p style="font-size:30px"> Badminton is a fun sport. Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a 
shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common 
forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).

<h2 style="font-size:65px"> Track </h2>
<p style="font-size:30px">Track and field is a sport which includes athletic contests 
established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing.The name is derived from 
the sport's typical venue: a stadium with an oval running track enclosing a grass field where 
the throwing and jumping events take place. It is one of the oldest sports. In ancient times, it 
was an event held in conjunction with festivals and sports meets such as the Ancient Olympic 
Games in Greece. The running events, which include sprints, middle and long-distance events, 
race walking and hurdling, are won by the athlete with the fastest time.

<p style="font-size:30px">Races over short distances, or sprints, are among the oldest running 
competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event, the 
stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other.Sprinting events are focused 
around athletes reaching and sustaining their quickest possible running speed. Three sprinting events 
are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 
400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements that later changed to metric

<h3 style="font-size:65px"> Computer Science </h3>
<p style="font-size:30px"> Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation 
and its applications. It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization 
of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, 
communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the 
study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation 
and the design of computational systems.
