<h1 style="font-size:50px"> About Me </h1>
<p>My name is Xinyu Lin. I'm currently a sophomore at Bronx High School of Science. 
I'm taking a computer science course here where I have learned to program in Python and 
to use Alice to make animations. Now, I'm working on a web design project in which 
we have to design websites and link them together using navigation bars. It has been a fun 
class because I like coding and programming.

<h2 style="font-size:50px">What I like to Do</h2>
<p>
I am a member of the school badminton and track team. Playing sports allows me to maintain a
calm mindset and to relax. Badminton is a cool sport. Many people think it is easy but 
it is not as easy as you may think. It requires a lot of planning and computations. Before 
you make your move, you should be planning for your next three moves. Running is also a 
fun sport. It allows you to build up your stamina and your body as well. Additioanlly, I 
am a big fan of nature; so here are so pictures of some nice natural views.
